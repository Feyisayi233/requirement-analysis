## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers, project managers, and stakeholders gather and define what the software product should achieve. It is the foundation of any successful software project, ensuring that all parties have a clear and shared understanding of the goals, features, and constraints of the system.

### üîç Why Requirement Analysis Matters:

- **Clarity & Focus:** It helps eliminate ambiguity by clearly documenting user expectations and business needs.
- **Project Scope:** Prevents scope creep by outlining exactly what will be delivered.
- **Efficient Design & Development:** Acts as a blueprint for system architecture, UI/UX design, and coding practices.
- **Time & Cost Estimation:** Supports accurate project planning by identifying resource needs early.
- **Quality Assurance:** Helps in testing and validation to ensure the product meets stakeholder expectations.

In summary, requirement analysis lays the groundwork for building reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software systems that solve real-world problems.
